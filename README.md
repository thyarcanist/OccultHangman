 Techno-Occult Hangman



In this mobile-based game, the player can play hangman using three forms of letter input. Standard, ASCII Binary or Phone Numpad style. Binary and Numpad both use dictionaries. In this project, I used ChatGPT to pair program for debugging purposes and brainstorming the best solutions.
