 Techno-Occult Hangman



In this mobile-based game, the player can play hangman using three forms of letter input. Standard, ASCII Binary or Phone Numpad style. Binary and Numpad both use dictionaries. In this project, I used ChatGPT to pair program for debugging purposes and brainstorming the best solutions.

This is more focused on the technical aspect, so I'm not to worried about how it looks at the moment.
